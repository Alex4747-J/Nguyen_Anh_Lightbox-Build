            <h3 class="lb-heading">Rafayel</h3>
            <p class="lb-text">As an artist, Rafayel appreciates fine art and beauty. His art style is like an infernoâ€” passionate and fiery, always leaving a profound impression on people. Most of his paintings are centered on Lemuria, an ancient civilization conceived in the oceans. Rafayel is Lemurian, one of the last members of the ancient race, and under specific circumstances has been shown to have scales and a tail. He lives in the Mo Art Studio situated on an island in Whitesand Bay, and hates cats.</p>

            <p class="lb-text">Recently, many citizens have been talking about a mysterious hunter who rescued them from Wanderers. With his combat prowess, he took down very dangerous Wanderers and disappeared in the blink of an eye, as if pursuing something greater. <br>
                We reached out to the witnesses. From their accounts, it seems their mysterious savior is Xavier, a Deepspace Hunter. <br>
                Xavier is able to fight monsters called Wanderers with the Player. His Evol type is Light, his primary weapon is a sword, and he often performs light-related sword combo attacks with the Player.</p>

            <p class="lb-text">
                Zayne can typically be found working at Akso Hospital. He is known for his cold and strict demeanor as well as his dedication to his work. He is a highly-awarded Cardiac Surgeon and is best known for his research in Congenital Heart Abnormalities in neonates. As the youngest recipient of the Starcatcher Award, Zayne has contributed to lowering the prevalence of congenital heart defects in newborns with his discovery that Evol genes affect the mutation rate of cells during heart development. <br>
                According to his Anecdote A Pure White Heart, despite his cold and intimidating nature, interns from all over are eager to work under Zayne and respect him highly. In the 2024 Meow's Time! event, Zayne mentions to the player that he learned how to braid hair by taking care of kids in Akso Hospital. <br>                
                Zayne suffers from nightmares and insomnia. When taking breaks or between work, he tends to indulge in eating sweets.</p>
